							Hi there, I am a Registered Dietitian who is
							passionate about integrating nutrition with fitness
							and lifestyle to assist individuals in achieving
							optimal health. My passion roots from a family
							history of diabetes and heart disease, which has
							driven me to become a Certified Diabetes Care and
							Education Specialist and obtain my Certificate in
							Obesity and Weight Management.
						</p>
						<p>
							With my own struggles with weight due to Polycystic
							Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), I am very compassionate and
							understanding with my clientâ€™s needs and struggles.
							I have worked with clients that have a variety of
							health concerns including diabetes, heart disease,
							obesity, Liver and Kidney diseases, emotional
							eating, eating disorders, dysphagia and tube
							feeding, nutritional decline in underweight
							individuals and much more. Take a glimpse at the
							services that Red Mountain Nutrition offers and do
							not hesitate to get in touch with me if you have any
							questions!
